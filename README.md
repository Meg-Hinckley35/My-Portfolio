# My-Portfolio

This project was challenging in a way I didn't expect.  I found a fun video online that showed so many new and different CSS styling ideas.  It was very interesting to see a webpage take shape like that.

This my first portfolio.  It was a challenge that I will continue to hard to improve.

I created anchor links in a navigaton section to connect to the info below.  So far I cannot quite tell why the anchor links are not working.

I was able to find and add icons from "font awesome".  Those were fun to play around with and style into shapes.

The code is broken down into an html file and a css file.  In the future I want to add more images and create more of gallery section for the project links.
