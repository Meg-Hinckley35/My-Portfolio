# My-Portfolio

This page is my portfolio.

I put a header in with my name and a small comment for creating something neat.

I have added a profile picture.
There is alternate text that explains what is in that img spot.
UPDATE: added a picture from internet instead of trying to insert picture from desktop.

I have created spaces in the html for me to add information about myself, my background, and where I can link my sample work.

I created anchor links in a navigaton bar to connect to the info cards.  So far I cannot quite tell why the anchor links are not working.

I added colors and card properties in a CSS file.

There are spaces for sample work links, but I have not added links yet.
